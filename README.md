# ARPG
A simple ARPG vertical slice, made to help me get familiar with the Unity engine

The player can equip themselves with various unique skills and a collection of randomly generated items to fight enemies in a randomly generated dungeon.

A quick demo of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YLV68rdnx4

This is NOT a complete game. It was created simply as a vertical slice to familiarize me with Unity 2Ds various systems and is not feature complete.
